                  <h1>About me</h1>
                  <p>
                      Greetings! I'm Alex, a passionate educator with a background in Electrical and Computer Engineering. At just 22 years old, I've immersed myself in the world of math, technology, and chess, driven by a deep love for these subjects and a belief in their transformative power.
      
                      My journey began with a natural affinity for math and analytical thinking. Recognizing its vital role in technology-related careers, I pursued a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering to further hone my skills. Along the way, I discovered the profound impact that chess has on cognitive development, instilling qualities like focus, self-reliance, patience, and strategic thinking.
                      
                      Equipped with these experiences, I've embarked on a mission to share this knowledge with young minds, aged 8-14. Through engaging lessons in coding, math, and chess, I aim to cultivate well-rounded individuals, emphasizing not just technical prowess, but also important life skills.                </p>

              <h1>Teaching methodology</h1>
              <p>
                  In my teaching, I hold certain key principles close to heart. First and foremost, I believe in personalized learning experiences. By tailoring examples and approaches to individual students, I ensure that each lesson resonates with them on a personal level.
      
                  Respect and open communication are cornerstones of my classroom. I value the opinions of my students and encourage them to ask questions and voice their thoughts. This fosters a dynamic learning environment where everyone feels heard and valued.
                  
                  While I'm dedicated to ensuring that learning is enjoyable and engaging, I also recognize the importance of discipline and focus. We set aside time for educational games and activities to keep things lively, but we never lose sight of our core learning objectives.                </p>

              <h1>What will I learn?</h1>
              <p>
                  I offer comprehensive courses in coding, math, and chess, tailored to the specific needs and interests of students aged 8-14. My curriculum is designed to take learners from foundational concepts to advanced proficiency, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of each subject.
